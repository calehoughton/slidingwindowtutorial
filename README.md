I am using data from the Phenoweb transect (see https://phenoweb.org) to look at when and how temperature affects the timing of the spring caterpillar peak and blue tit breeding. The data includes 44 sites sampled over 8 years.

Here I:

Explored the caterpillar and temperature data sets
Used a sliding window analysis to find the period of time when temperature best predicts the timing of the caterpillar peak
Plotted the results of the sliding window analysis and visualised the effect of temperature on the caterpillar peak timing.
Used a permutation test to determine how likely we were to identify this window by chance.
